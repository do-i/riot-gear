# @markup markdown

# 0.0.9

* get, post, put, delete can have responses saved for use in other requests within the same (or nested) context [jaknowlden]

```ruby
context GoNuts do
  post(:the_new_nut) do
    { :path => "/make/some", :body => "..." }
  end

  get do
    { :path => "/get/some/#{response(:the_new_nut)["id"]}" }
  end
end
```

The last get, post, put, or delete in the context will still be the one used for assertions.

* get, post, put, delete can take a block that expects a settings hash to be returned (with a path) [jaknowlden]

```ruby
context GoNuts do
  post do
    { :path => "/make/some", :body => "..." }
  end

  get do
    { :path => "/get/some", :query => { ... } }
  end
end
```

* tons of documentation [jaknowlden]
